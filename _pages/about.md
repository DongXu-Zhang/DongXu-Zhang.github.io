<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I work at XJTU as a master now in Xi'an. 
I am now working on point cloud registration(PCR) and 3D-Vision. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [zhangdongxu@stu.xjtu.edu.cn](mailto:zhangdongxu@stu.xjtu.edu.cn).

I graduated from [Computer Science College](https://ccst.tyut.edu.cn/), Taiyuan University of Technology with a bachelor's degree and from the Department of Software Engineer, Xi'an Jiaotong University with a master's degree.
