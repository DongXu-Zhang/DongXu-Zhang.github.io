I am currently a Master's student at the **Department of Software Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU)**, advised by [Prof. Jihua Zhu](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/zhujh). I graduated from [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://ccst.tyut.edu.cn/), Taiyuan University of Technology with a bachelor's degree. I am collaborating closely with [Ning Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=b4cE0J4AAAAJ) at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA).

**🚀I am now working on LLM Reasoning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Currently, I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities for the Fall 2027 intake.** I am particularly interested in advancing LLM Reasoning and Multimodal Learning. If you are looking for a self-motivated student with a strong background in 3D-Vision and LLM, or if you are interested in academic collaboration, I would be honored to discuss further via email at [zhangdongxu@stu.xjtu.edu.cn](mailto:zhangdongxu@stu.xjtu.edu.cn).


# 🔥 News

Currently, I am a Visiting Student at the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (Shanghai AI Lab), where I am privileged to be advised by [Cheng Tan](https://chengtan9907.github.io/). My research primarily focuses on AI for Science and LLM Reasoning.

[Jan. 2026] 🔥 Excited to share our new preprint "**Chain-of-Thought Compression Should Not Be Blind: V-Skip for Efficient Multimodal Reasoning via Dual-Path Anchoring**" on arXiv! We propose **V-Skip** to address "Visual Amnesia" in MLLM reasoning compression. Check out the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13879) and [project page](https://dongxu-zhang.github.io/v-skip.github.io/)!

[Jan. 2026] 🎉 Excited to share that our paper "IGASA: Integrated Geometry-Aware and Skip-Attention Modules for Enhanced Point Cloud Registration" has been accepted by IEEE TCSVT!

[Jan. 2026] 🎉 Excited to share that our paper "CMHANet: A Cross-Modal Hybrid Attention Network for Point Cloud Registration" has been accepted by Neurocomputing!

[Jan. 2026] 🎉 Excited to share that our paper "DEEP LOCAL FIELD CONSISTENCY FOR NON-RIGID POINT CLOUD REGISTRATION" has been accepted by ICASSP!
